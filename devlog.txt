DEVELOPMENT LOG

Journal

2014-01-07
Created project proposal.

2014-01-09
Planned java classes to create. Discussed creating a tree for more efficient searches.
Peter started writing a wiki describing the query grammar.

2014-01-10
Continued planning. 

2014-01-14
Created sample database for testing.

2014-01-16
Began work on Interface and Parser.

2014-01-17
Continued work on Interface and Parser, began work on Engine.

2014-01-21
Projects diverged. Peter began working on a query language implementation using antlr, Lydia continued to work on creating a parser and engine from scratch.
Created Database to store databases.

2014-01-22
Got EngineGen and EngineString working.

2014-01-23
Got EngineNum working. Created new sample database. Put final touches on project, commented code.


Obstacles Overcome
Not having multiple-word phrases entered by user being split up into different elements of the query array. Resolved by consulting Stack Overflow.
Finding a way to deal with comparison operators that did not involve writing the same code over and over again for "=", "<", "<=", etc. Resolved by creating a function to parse these operators.

Unresolved Issues
Dealing with errors in query input (i.e. returning a specific and helpful error message to the user).
Expanding query language to be able to return multiple specified columns at once and to handle multiple conditions (could be implemented with more time).
Creating larger sample databases.

Cool Stuff Learned
How to split strings into arrays
How to read in files
Exceptions handling

Mid-Development Design Changes
At first EngineGen.java was going to be an interface, but then it seemed more useful as a superclass, and finally it became a regular class of its own.
There was going to be a class EngineBool.java but the functionality planned for it was already covered by EngineString.java.

Lessons Learned
Plan for code to as general as possible so it is easier to add functionality later on.
Make a clear plan at the beginning of who is doing what and how everything is going to fit together.
